# Getting Started with Book Shop

## Problem Statement
To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book 
purchases. One copy of any of the five books costs $8. If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books. 
If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount. If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount. 
If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.

Note: that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book 
still costs $8. Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of 
the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.
For example, how much does this basket of books cost?
2 copies of the first book 2 copies of the second book 2 copies of the third book 1 copy of the fourth book 1 copy of the fifth book
